    I'm an assistant professor at COLTEC/UFMG, responsible for lecturing Basic Programming, Web Development, and Mobile Development classes.
    Also, I'm a member of the Applied Software Engineering Research Group (aSERG), where we conduct empirical research in software engineering.

    My interests are related to software maintenance and evolution, mining software repositories, and empirical software engineering.
    Currently, I am working with mining software repositories and machine learning techniques to map software developers' expertise based on their activity in Social Code Platforms (aka GitHub and Stack Overflow).
