<p>Weekly report is a simple and lightweight reporter system used by ASERG group. Basically the system registers users that must fill activities reports periodically, and send it to the research group. Also, the system reminds the users which did not fill the report yet.</p>

<p>The system has been implemented using Ruby on Rails (for learning purposes), and is available at this <a href="http://github.com/jemaf/weekly-report">link</a>.</p>
