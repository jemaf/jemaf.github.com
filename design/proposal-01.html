        <p>
            I'm an assistant professor at COLTEC/UFMG, responsible for lecturing Basic Programming, Web Development, and Mobile
            Development classes.
            Also, I'm a member of the Applied Software Engineering Research Group (aSERG), where we conduct empirical research
            in
            software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests are related to software maintenance and evolution, mining software repositories, and empirical software
            engineering.
            Currently, I am working with mining software repositories and machine learning techniques to map software
            developers'
            expertise based on their activity in Social Code Platforms (aka GitHub and Stack Overflow).
